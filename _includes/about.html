    <div class="summary">
        <p>Theoretical computer scientist and AI researcher bridging quantum computing and production-scale machine learning systems. PhD in Physics from Harvard (completed at age 22) with MIT postdoctoral training under Scott Aaronson in quantum information and complexity theory. Currently holds TS/SCI clearance conducting quantum algorithm research at Sandia National Laboratories through a joint Google Quantum AI initiative, specializing in variational quantum eigensolvers for lattice gauge theory, quantum error correction protocols using surface codes, and tensor network methods for quantum many-body simulation with 50+ qubit systems.</p>
        <p>Architect of advanced AI systems spanning multiple domains: developed multi-modal RAG architectures combining dense retrieval (FAISS), graph neural networks (Neo4j), and constitutional AI reasoning for processing 10M+ scientific papers with 40% improvement in relevance metrics. Built production reinforcement learning trading systems using deep Q-networks and transformer models achieving 23% Sharpe ratio improvement while processing 1B+ financial transactions daily with microsecond latency. Created federated learning frameworks across multiple medical institutions for COVID-19 detection (93% accuracy) using EfficientNet-B7 with differential privacy guarantees. Google Summer of Code Fellow (2024-2025) developing meta-learning algorithms for adaptive retrieval and causal inference frameworks, with proven track record deploying mission-critical AI systems in national security, healthcare, fintech, and cybersecurity contexts.</p>
